      <strong>Lesson 7: Adding Search and Query</strong>
      <em><br />Rebecca Ubalde</em>
      <strong><br /><br />Wildfires in the United States (2000-2018)</strong>

      <p>
        The map displayed above shows wildfire incidents that have occurred in
        the United States between 2000 and 2018. To use the map, enter a fire
        year in the search prompt to display all the wildfires that have
        occurred within that year. Then search for the wildfire incident name in
        the search bar or select a fire incident to view its information. The
        information includes the state where the fire occurred, the year the
        fire occurred, how many acres burned, and the responsible land agency.
        The data was obtained from the

      <strong>Lesson 7 Reflection</strong>
      <p>
        For this assignment, I created a web application focused on wildfires in
        the United States as they have a significant impact on botanical
        species, making wildfires a crucial concern for me as a botanist. The
        data includes infamous wildfires in Nevada such as the Fork fire and
        Goodsprings fire, both of which required massive restoration efforts
        that included seeding and outplanting. In the previous assignment, I
        used visual variables to display data, so for this lesson, I opted to
        display data using the Class Break Renderer in order to practice with
        different renderer code. I also utilized Color Brewer to obtain logical
        color values that represented the wildfires burned by size (in acres).

      <p>
        I found this lesson to be much more straightforward due to having
        established better understanding and knowledge from previous lessons.
        The module lessons also provided helpful guidance on how to accomplish
        the required tasks such as creating the search widget and performing a
        query using definition expressions. However, I encountered difficulties
        understanding the concepts presented in Lesson 7.2.2, "Getting Feature
        Counts," and Lesson 7.2.3, "Promises," particularly in regards to
        understanding the methods used in each example. In order to gain a
        better understanding, I would have to revisit these concepts multiple
        times and view additional examples until I feel more confident. In
        addition, I encountered a challenge with my map failing to load, but
        later realized that the sequential order of my code was incorrect and
        was then able to fix the issue.
